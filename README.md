# DENV

The provided R code **“DENGUE-serotyopes”** aims to download, process and clean up the complete genome sequences of Dengue Virus (*Orthoflavivirus denguei*) of the four serotypes (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, DENV4) from the NCBI nucleotide database. It uses several functions to perform secure HTTP requests, search for genome IDs, download sequences in FASTA format, validate the downloaded sequences, and combine them into a single file. In addition, the code includes a process to remove gaps and undetermined nucleotides from the combined sequences. This process is crucial for obtaining high-quality genomic data, which is essential for research studies, treatment development, viral identification techniques such as RT-PCR and RT-LAMP, and dengue vaccines. The automation of these tasks allows handling large volumes of data efficiently and accurately with the use of High Performance Computing (HPC), facilitating progress in understanding and combating this disease in endemic countries such as Colombia.
